We thought we’d take a\n            quick look at the famed localhost of 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and share\n            some best practices from the Men&Mice team on how to make the best\n            out of working from home. Or 127.0.0.1 (::1 for the IPv6-minded), as\n            it were.\n          </p>\n          <h4>Localhost where the heart is</h4>\n          <p>\n            It’s a true testament to how slowly things move in our industry when\n            you consider that the name of localhost has been introduced in 1996,\n            but only achieved ‘standard’ status in 2013. The standard of IPv4\n            reserves all 16 million addresses (give or take) of the 127.0.0.0/8\n            range for loopback. In IPv6, it’s only a single one: ::1. (Read more\n            about IPv6 reserved addresses here.) In IPv4, 127.0.0.1 is the\n            default that most computers use: in the hosts file (/etc/hosts in\n            Linux and Mac systems; C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts on\n            Windows), which acts as a local DNS resolver is usually empty except\n            for these two lines:\n          </p>\n          <ol>\n            <li>{`def rule(Hodor,y){`}</li>\n            <li>{` rule()`}</li>\n            <li>{`}`}</li>\n            <li>{`var Sansa = COLS`}</li>\n            <li>{`def TABLE[-Jon][i] {`}</li>\n            <li>{` (rule(-TABLE[ROWS][y]) * --(Jon) / 1 * ((`}</li>\n            <li>{`foo(Jon, TABLE[0.52][-COLS])))) + -33;`}</li>\n            <li>{` Arya += betray(Sansa,-COLS * -COLS) - -38 `}</li>\n            <li>{`}`}</li>\n          </ol>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      {/* .body */}\n    </>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Body;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AALA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAYA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AACA;AACA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
