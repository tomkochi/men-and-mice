We thought we’d\n              take a quick look at the famed localhost of 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and\n              share some best practices from the Men&Mice team on how to make\n              the best out of working from home. Or 127.0.0.1 (::1 for the\n              IPv6-minded), as it were.\n            </p>\n            <h4>Localhost where the heart is</h4>\n            <p>\n              It’s a true testament to how slowly things move in our industry\n              when you consider that the name of localhost has been introduced\n              in 1996, but only achieved ‘standard’ status in 2013. The standard\n              of IPv4 reserves all 16 million addresses (give or take) of the\n              127.0.0.0/8 range for loopback. In IPv6, it’s only a single one:\n              ::1. (Read more about IPv6 reserved addresses here.) In IPv4,\n              127.0.0.1 is the default that most computers use: in the hosts\n              file (/etc/hosts in Linux and Mac systems;\n              C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts on Windows), which acts as a\n              local DNS resolver is usually empty except for these two lines:\n            </p>\n            <ol>\n              <li>{`def rule(Hodor,y){`}</li>\n              <li>&nbsp;{`rule()`}</li>\n              <li>{`}`}</li>\n              <li>{`var Sansa = COLS`}</li>\n              <li>{`def TABLE[-Jon][i] {`}</li>\n              <li>&nbsp;{` (rule(-TABLE[ROWS][y]) * --(Jon) / 1 * ((`}</li>\n              <li>{`foo(Jon, TABLE[0.52][-COLS])))) + -33;`}</li>\n              <li>&nbsp;{` Arya += betray(Sansa,-COLS * -COLS) - -38 `}</li>\n              <li>{`}`}</li>\n            </ol>\n            <p>\n              It is defined locally, as the loopback addresses shouldn’t be sent\n              to public name servers to avoid confusion. Because of its special\n              status, even machines without an actual network interface (wired\n              or wireless connections, or even the hardware capability for\n              connections) can still use localhost through the networking stack\n              of the operating system. Air gapped computers can run network\n              services (such as web servers like Apache or nginx) locally.\n            </p>\n            <h4>127.0.0.1 or localhost?</h4>\n            <p>\n              In most cases: either work. There’s one notable case where the two\n              are different: when using a MySQL server, it does matter whether\n              using 127.0.0.1 or localhost in your preferences.\n            </p>\n            <h4>Working from 127.0.0.1 (::1)</h4>\n            <p>\n              Men&Mice is fortunate in being able to encourage employees to work\n              from home. The health and safety of our people are our highest\n              priorities at all times. Working remotely, however, is a tricky\n              situation. Even under the best of circumstances it creates a\n              disruption, and can take a heavy toll on mental health and\n              productivity. Our team members aren’t strangers to remote work,\n              but even for them, this is new. When the benefit of an optional\n              change of scenery becomes the new status quo that is recommended\n              or even mandated, being smart is essential. We’ve asked the\n              Men&Mice team to share their tips and best practices — hope this\n              helps all of you struggling to adjust to the new situation.\n            </p>\n            <ul className=\"navbar-nav d-flex flex-row\">\n              <li className=\"nav-item px-3 text-uppercase\">\n                <a href=\"\" className=\"nav-link\">\n                  home network\n                </a>\n              </li>\n              <li className=\"nav-item px-3 text-uppercase\">\n                <a href=\"\" className=\"nav-link\">\n                  dhcp\n                </a>\n              </li>\n              <li className=\"nav-item px-3 text-uppercase\">\n                <a href=\"\" className=\"nav-link\">\n                  127.0.0.1\n                </a>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </div>\n          {/* .wrapper */}\n        </div>\n        {/* content */}\n      </div>\n      {/* .body */}\n      <style jsx>{`\n        .body {\n          .head,\n          .content {\n            .wrapper {\n              width: calc(100vw - 60px);\n              max-width: 680px;\n              margin: 0 auto;\n              a {\n                font-family: \"Apercu Bold\";\n                font-size: 18px;\n                color: #ffffff;\n                svg {\n                  margin-right: 12px;\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n          .head {\n            background: transparent;\n          }\n          .content {\n            background: #ffffff;\n          }\n        }\n      `}</style>\n    </>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Body;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AALA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAYA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAaA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AA1GA;AAAA;AAAA;AAiJA;AACA;AACA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
